            A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable
            personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually
            11 to 17 in or 280 to 430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and
            pointing device (such as a trackpad and/or trackpoint) on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs
            with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".[1][2] Most of the
            computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many
            laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen and some modern ones even feature a touch-screen
            display. In most cases, unlike table computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on
            desktop operating systems which have been traditionally associated with desktop computers.

            Laptops run on both an AC power supply and a rechargeable battery pack and can be folded shut for convenient
            storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use.[3] Today, laptops are used in a variety of
            settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing, for
            personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

            The names "laptop" and "notebook" refer to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (or on
            top of) the user's lap and can be used similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the terms
            "laptop" and "notebook" are used interchangeably;[4] in other dialects of English, one or the other may be
            preferred. Although the term "notebook" originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller
            and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),[5] the term has come to mean the same thing and no longer
            refers to any specific size.
