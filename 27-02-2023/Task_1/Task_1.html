            HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them
            functional.

            The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later
            tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

            HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper
            Text Markup Language.

            Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the
            document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

            A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and
            presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
