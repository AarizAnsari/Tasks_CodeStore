            Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes
            <br>in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

        <p class="content">
            Like function expressions, class expressions may be anonymous, or have a name that's different from the
            variable that it's assigned to. However, unlike function declarations, class declarations have the same
            temporal dead zone restrictions as let or const and behave as if they are not hoisted.
