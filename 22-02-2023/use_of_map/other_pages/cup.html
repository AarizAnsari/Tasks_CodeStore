            A coffee cup is a container, a cup, for serving coffee and coffee-based drinks. 
            There are three major types: conventional cups used with saucers, mugs used without 
            saucers, and disposable cups. Cups and mugs generally have a handle. Disposable paper 
            cups used for take-out sometimes have fold-out handles, but are more often used with an 
            insulating coffee cup sleeve.

            Coffee cups and mugs may be made of glazed ceramic, porcelain, plastic, glass, insulated or 
            uninsulated metal, and other materials. Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or 
            polystyrene foam (often mistakenly called Styrofoam).
